# keyword-highlighter-extension
An extension to highlight multiple keywords on a page, similar to CTRL + F, which highlights only one. 

The idea behind this extension is to help speed up the process of identifying suitable jobs to apply to, by highlighting multiple keywords on glassdoor, linked in such as: Junior, React, JavaScript, Tailwind, Hybrid, Salary'

This app allows me to go trhough a lot more applications in a day and find the most suitable jobs for me by scanning through all keywords first, or identifying that a job is not for me when there are no highlighted keywords. I have been using this personal extension for a while to help me with my job search.
