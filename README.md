# keyword-highlighter-extension
An extension to highlight multiple keywords on a page, similar to CTRL + F, which highlights only one. 

# Keyword Highlighter Extension

This Chrome extension enhances the traditional CTRL + F functionality by allowing users to highlight multiple keywords simultaneously on web pages. Unlike the standard search feature that highlights only one keyword at a time, this extension supports multiple keywords, which are added by the user and displayed in a vertical list on the extension's interface.

## Purpose and Benefits

The primary purpose of this extension is to streamline and expedite the process of scanning through digital content, such as job listings on platforms like GlassDoor and LinkedIn. By enabling the highlighting of multiple relevant keywords (e.g., 'Junior, React, JavaScript, Tailwind, Hybrid, Salary'), users can quickly assess whether a job or content aligns with their criteria. This functionality is particularly beneficial for job seekers who need to sift through vast amounts of listings to find suitable positions, significantly speeding up their search and application process.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Keyword Highlighting:** Enter and list multiple keywords which are then simultaneously highlighted on the current webpage.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Add keywords through a simple input field and manage them easily in a vertically arranged list.
- **Efficient Navigation:** Quickly navigate through highlighted terms to assess relevance and content alignment.
- **Customization:** Users can customize the highlight colors, making different categories of keywords stand out.

## Usage

1. **Installation:** The extension can be added to Chrome from the GitHub repository.
2. **Adding Keywords:** Users can type their desired keywords into the input field in the extension's dropdown menu.
3. **Highlighting:** Once added, navigate to any webpage and the entered keywords will be automatically highlighted.

## Development and Contributions

This extension was developed as a personal project to aid in job searching but has since been made available on GitHub for public use and improvement. Users are encouraged to fork the repository, contribute to the codebase, and suggest new features or improvements.

## About the Developer

This tool was created out of a personal need to enhance job search efficiency by quickly identifying key job requirements and desirable positions. It has been instrumental in my own job search, and I hope it can assist others in their professional endeavors.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to its development on GitHub.
